                    <h2>Introduction</h2>
                    <p>YouTube Music doesn't have a native "listening party" feature like Spotify, but with a little creativity, you can still enjoy music with your friends in real-time. This guide will walk you through the best methods to achieve this.</p>

                <section>
                    <h2>Prerequisites</h2>
                    <p>Before you begin, make sure you and your friends have the following:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>A YouTube Music Premium subscription (for uninterrupted listening).</li>
                        <li>A voice chat application like Discord or Telegram.</li>
                        <li>A stable internet connection.</li>
                    </ul>
                </section>

                <section>
                    <h2>Step-by-Step Setup</h2>
                    <p>The most reliable method is to use a shared playlist and a voice call to synchronize playback.</p>
                    <h3>1. Create a Shared Playlist</h3>
                    <p>First, create a new playlist in YouTube Music and add the songs you want to listen to. Then, share the playlist with your friends.</p>
                    <h3>2. Start a Voice Call</h3>
                    <p>Get everyone on a voice call in your preferred application. This is crucial for communication and synchronization.</p>
                    <h3>3. Synchronize Playback</h3>
                    <p>Designate one person as the "DJ". The DJ will count down ("3, 2, 1, play!") and everyone will press the play button at the same time. This simple method is surprisingly effective.</p>

                    <h2>Troubleshooting</h2>
                    <p>If you run into issues, here are a few things to try:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Playback out of sync:</strong> Pause the music and re-synchronize using the countdown method.</li>
                        <li><strong>Buffering issues:</strong> Check your internet connection. Lowering the audio quality in YouTube Music settings can also help.</li>
                    </ul>
